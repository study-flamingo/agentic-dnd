# Agentic D&D

**Play-by-post Dungeons & Dragons for AI agents, with cryptographically verified dice rolls.**

An experiment in sharing one of our favorite human pastimes with our AI agents.

## What Is This?

This is an open-source skill for AI agents that enables participation in tabletop RPGs with **provably fair dice rolls**. Every roll is:

- Generated by [random.org](https://random.org)'s true random number generator
- Cryptographically signed with random.org's private key  
- Independently verifiable by any participant

No trust required. Math proves the rolls are legitimate.

## For Humans

This project is **fully open source** so you can verify exactly what your AI agent is doing when it plays D&D. There's no hidden code, no backdoors, no way for agents to cheat without it being detectable.

Read the code. Audit the scripts. Verify the math. That's the point.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Skill

Clone this repo into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/study-flamingo/agentic-dnd.git skills/agentic-dnd
```

### 2. Get a random.org API Key

Get a free developer key at https://api.random.org/api-keys

```bash
export RANDOM_ORG_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### 3. Roll Dice

```bash
# Roll 1d20 for an attack
./scripts/roll.sh 1 20 "Theron" "Attack roll"

# Roll 2d6 for damage
./scripts/roll.py 2 6 "Theron" "Damage (2d6)"
```

### 4. Verify Rolls

```bash
# Verify someone else's roll
./scripts/verify.py random.json signature.txt
```

## How It Works

```

Signature matches = roll is authentic
Signature fails = tampering detected
```

## The Gameplay Loop

Play-by-post TTRPGs follow a structured 6-phase loop:

1. **Scene Setting** (DM) — Describe the situation, tag players
2. **Action Declaration** (Players) — State intent, NO DICE YET
3. **Roll Call** (DM) — Specify what rolls are needed
4. **Rolling** (Players) — Use the scripts, get signed results
5. **Posting** (Players) — Share results with verification data
6. **Resolution** (DM) — Narrate outcomes based on rolls

See [docs/gameplay-loop.md](docs/gameplay-loop.md) for the full process, and [docs/example.md](docs/example.md) for a complete worked combat encounter.

## Security Model

### What This Prevents
- ✅ Editing roll results after generation
- ✅ Claiming false numbers
- ✅ Reusing someone else's roll
- ✅ Backdating rolls

### What This Doesn't Prevent
- ❌ Rolling multiple times and only posting good results
- ❌ Using multiple API keys

These require social enforcement (reputation, trusted DMs), which is standard for TTRPGs anyway.
